FINAL RESULTS:

./MFCApplication1/Common/SG_InputBox.cpp:52:  [4] (buffer) lstrcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using a function version that stops copying at the end
  of the buffer.
./MFCApplication1/Common/NetworkTCP.cpp:602:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
./MFCApplication1/Common/NetworkTCP.cpp:651:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
./MFCApplication1/Common/Protocol/Msg/protocolLogin.pb.cc:2059:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
./MFCApplication1/Common/Protocol/ProtocolManager.cpp:53:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
./MFCApplication1/Common/SG_InputBox.h:36:  [2] (buffer) wchar_t:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
./MFCApplication1/Common/SG_InputBox.h:50:  [2] (buffer) wchar_t:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
./MFCApplication1/Common/UdpSendRecvJpeg.cpp:38:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
./MFCApplication1/ProtocolDef.h:59:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
./MFCApplication1/ProtocolDef.h:67:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
